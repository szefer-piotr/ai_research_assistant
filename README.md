# The AI-Powered Research Assistant

An AI-driven workspace designed to assist researchers in analyzing data, writing, and organizing their work effectively.

# Overview

Over my ten years of experience as a scientist, I have encountered numerous challenges faced by the ecological research community. One of the most significant issues is the difficulty in performing reliable statistical analyses. Without proper tools, data collection efforts are often poorly directed, leading to a high effort-to-outcome ratio. In ecology, obtaining data is a labor-intensive and costly endeavor. Optimizing these efforts through better experimental design and analysis can lead to more impactful research while reducing costs.

*Example Use Case*: APRA could help researchers calculate the number of observations needed to answer a specific research question or test a hypothesis with sufficient statistical powerâ€”an aspect that is often overlooked in experimental planning.

Another key challenge is the difficulty in comparing results due to varying scales and mixed concepts. With the exponential growth of published research, finding and synthesizing relevant information has become increasingly complex. However, with the centralization of ecological data in repositories like DRYAD, there is an opportunity to harness AI to integrate this knowledge. The ultimate goal is to build a unified framework that enhances research focus and advances ecological understanding.

# How to run

This is a Stremalit (v.1.43) chat app that uses the OpenAI's assistant code interpreter.

Create a new environment
```
python -m venv venv
```

Install all dependencies.
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Run the app in browser.
```
streamlit run poc_scripts/chat_simple_v3.py
```

## Planned Features

I aim to implement the following features in APRA:

- Natural language querying for tabular data.
- Automated R code generation based on research questions or hypotheses.
- Tools for positioning research within a broader scientific context.
- A writing assistant to suggest citations and improve manuscript clarity.
- A publishing assistant for automatic formatting tailored to specific journal requirements.
- Collaboration suggestions and recommendations for future research steps.
- A system to build knowledge maps that link related research questions.
- An experimental design assistant to streamline and optimize data collection efforts.
- These features represent my vision for APRA's potential and will be developed iteratively as the project progresses. My goal is to empower ecological researchers with tools that make their work more efficient, impactful, and collaborative.
