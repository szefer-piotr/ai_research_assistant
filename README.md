# The AI-powered Research Assistant

The AI-powered workspace to help you analyze your data, write, and organize your research. 

Throughouth my ten year experience as a scientist I have encountered many problems that the scientific ecological community was facing in tehir work. Key issue was a reliable statistical analysis of data. Whithoth an access to that their efforts in comllecting data were very often not focused resulting in high effort/outcome ratios. Obtainig data in ecology is an enourmous and costly effort and thus focusing efforts can translate to more money being spent on designing and analysing experiments. Statistical power of analysis is often overlooked.

Example: APRA would calculate, how many observations need to be collected to achieve a goal, which would be an answer to a specified question or hypothesis.

Very often results are difficult to compare, scales differ and concepts are getting mixed up. Therefore it is difficult to search for related informations, especially, with exponentially growing numbers of published papers. 

With more data in ecology starting to be centralized in repositories like DRYAD, we could use the power of AI to help us integrate all that knowledge and build a unified knowledge, that would focus our efforts in developing ecological knowledge.
