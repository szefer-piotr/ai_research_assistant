    "we extracted the first two PCA axes for use in our models. These two axes explained 92.4% of the total variation in morphological characteristics (Fig. S2). \n",
    "For each descriptor, we built two models: one without the morphological characteristics of plants and one including them, \n",
    "to assess the significance of morphology in explaining the differences. \n",
    "Likelihood ratio tests were used to compare the models and determine whether the inclusion of morphological characteristics improved model performance. \n",
    "Each statistical model also incorporated local weather conditions (wind, temperature, and cloud cover) as covariates to provide as much statistical control as possible when comparing the Solidago taxa. Although humidity was recorded during each sampling session, it was excluded due to its high correlation with air temperature. To evaluate model performance, we tested various error distributions. The Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) was used to select the best-performing model. Response variables were normalized, when needed, using a log transformation or a log-shift transformation. For each characteristic, models with a following structures were compared:\n",
    "Y ∼ {β} rsub {plantspecies × location} + {β} rsub {plantspecies × timewindow} + {β} rsub {temperature} + {β} rsub {wind} + {β} rsub {cloud} + ε \n",

    "Where  in all cases. We used the adjusted R² values of each model to evaluate its explanatory power. \n",
    "For the best-performing models, total visits, Diptera visits, and Diptera species richness were log-shift transformed prior to analysis, \n",
    "while Diptera visit duration was log-transformed. Species diversity (Shannon Index) did not require transformation. \n",
    "After normalization all models assumed a Gaussian error distribution. \n",
    "Post-hoc tests with Tukey correction were conducted to evaluate the significance of differences between the Solidago taxa. \n",
    "We performed a Redundancy Analysis (RDA) on the chemical composition of individual species to identify significant differences between the Solidago taxa. \n",
    "However, these chemical composition data were not linked to the insect sampling data, \n",
