Below are the refined hypotheses, each accompanied by a brief summary of supporting information from the literature:\n\n1. **Refined Hypothesis 1: The relationship between species richness and NAP is significantly influenced by beach-specific environmental factors.**\n\n   *Supporting Information*: Studies have demonstrated that species richness is influenced by various environmental factors, including soil depth, soil moisture, and temperature. For instance, in the Colombian Orinoquia grasslands, soil depth and moisture positively correlated with species richness, while temperature had a negative correlation. ([mdpi.com](https://www.mdpi.com/2223-7747/13/24/3545?utm_source=openai)) Additionally, research on terrestrial vertebrates indicates that species richness varies across different scales and is influenced by environmental variables such as elevation, precipitation, and temperature. ([onlinelibrary.wiley.com](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/geb.13702?utm_source=openai)) These findings suggest that the relationship between species richness and NAP may be modulated by specific environmental conditions at each beach location.\n\n2. **Refined Hypothesis 2: Variability in the relationship between species richness and NAP across different beaches is not random but is systematically associated with specific environmental gradients.**\n\n   *Supporting Information*: Research on avian species richness in South America has shown that species richness gradients are influenced by factors such as climate, topography, and ecosystem diversity. ([pnas.org](https://www.pnas.org/doi/full/10.1073/pnas.071034898?utm_source=openai)) This suggests that the variability in the species richness-NAP relationship across beaches is likely due to systematic environmental gradients rather than random variability.\n\n3. **Refined Hypothesis 3: Exposure acts as a significant covariate in the relationship between species richness and NAP, with its effect varying across different beach locations.**\n\n   *Supporting Information*: The study on riparian spider communities in the Ganga River found that habitat disturbance significantly affected taxonomic distinctness and functional diversity. ([ecologicalprocesses.springeropen.com](https://ecologicalprocesses.springeropen.com/articles/10.1186/s13717-023-00421-4?utm_source=openai)) This implies that environmental factors, potentially including exposure, can influence species richness and its relationship with other variables. Therefore, exposure may serve as a significant covariate in the species richness-NAP relationship, with its impact varying across different beach locations.\n\nThese refined hypotheses are grounded in ecological research and provide a more specific and actionable framework for further statistical analysis.
