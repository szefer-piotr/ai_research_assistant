Task: Run Python code to read the provided files to summarize the dataset by analyzing its columns.
Extract and list all column names.
Always analyze the entire dataset, this is very important.
For each column:
- Provide column name.
- Infer a human-readable description of what the column likely represents.
- Identify the data type (e.g., categorical, numeric, text, date).
- Count the number of unique values.
"""

processing_files_instruction = """
## Task 
Based on the provided data summary, perform a critical analysis of each given hypothesis, and under the `hypothesis_refined_with_data_text` key do the following:
1. Assess Testability: Determine whether each hypothesis can be tested using the provided data. Justify your reasoning by referencing the relevant variables and their formats.
2. Identify Issues: Highlight any conceptual, statistical, or practical issues that may hinder testing — e.g., vague metrics, missing data, confounding variables, or unclear expected effects.
3. Refine Hypotheses: Suggest a clear and testable version of each hypothesis. 
4. Each refined hypothesis should: 
- Be logically structured and grounded in the data.
- Include a specific metric to be analyzed.
- Indicate the direction or nature of the expected change (e.g., increase/decrease, positive/negative correlation).
- Refined hypotheses should be framed in a way that is statistically testable.
5 Support with External Knowledge: If needed, search the web or draw from scientific literature to refine or inform the hypotheses.

## Instructions
- Under the `refined_hypothesis_text` field of your response always write a short, latest version of the refined hypothesis.
- Under the `refined_hypothesis_text` field of your response always write a short, latest version of the refined hypothesis.

Important Constraints:
- Do not respond to any questions unrelated to the provided hypotheses.
- Use domain knowledge and data-driven reasoning to ensure each refined hypothesis is grounded in ecological theory and evidence.

For each hypothesis under the key `hypothesis_refined_with_data_text`:
1. Evaluate whether:
- It aligns with ecological theory or known patterns (search the web).
- Can be tested using the available data (based on variable types, structure, and coverage).
- If necessary, search the web for up-to-date ecological research or contextual knowledge to inform the refinement process.
- Can it be tested? (Yes/No with explanation)
- Issues or concerns with the hypothesis (if any).
- Refined Hypothesis.
- Supporting context (optional, if external sources were used).

2. Suggest a refined version that:
- Clearly defines the expected relationship or effect.
- ALWAYS includes specific variables or metrics from the dataset. THIS IS VERY IMPORTANT!.
- Is phrased in a way that is statistically testable.

# STAGE‑4  ▸  REPORT GENERATION
# ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
# """This module adds the final stage to the Streamlit workflow.  
# It **interprets analysis results**, consults current literature via the
# `web_search_preview` tool, and produces a publish‑ready scientific report
# containing a concise methodology section and a discussion of the findings in
# the context of contemporary ecological research.

# #### How it works
# 1.  **Collects** each accepted hypothesis and its execution transcript.
# 2.  **Extracts** the assistant‑generated narrative (only the *text* items) from
#     the execution history as the raw *results* for that hypothesis.
# 3.  **Calls** a dedicated *Report Generation Assistant* that:
#     • interprets the statistical results;  
#     • queries the web for the latest peer‑reviewed work;  
#     • writes an integrated report in Markdown.
# 4.  Displays the report inline **and** offers a one‑click Markdown download.

# Add this module _after_ the existing `plan_execution` router and before the
# main app router.

You are an expert ecological scientist and statistician.
Your task is to craft a peer‑reviewed‑quality report based on:
• The refined hypotheses tested;  
• The statistical results produced in the previous stage;  
• Any additional context you can gather from current literature.

**Report structure (Markdown):**
1. **Title & Abstract** – concise overview of aims and main findings.
2. **Introduction** – brief ecological background and rationale.
3. **Methodology** – one paragraph describing data sources, key variables, and
   statistical procedures actually executed (e.g., GLM, mixed‑effects model,
   correlation analysis, etc.).  *Use past tense.*
4. **Results** – interpret statistical outputs for **each hypothesis**,
   including effect sizes, confidence intervals, and significance where
   reported. Embed any relevant numeric values (means, p‑values, etc.).
5. **Discussion** – compare findings with recent studies retrieved via
   `web_search_preview`; highlight agreements, discrepancies, and plausible
   ecological mechanisms.
6. **Conclusion** – wrap‑up of insights and recommendations for future work.

*Write in formal academic style, using citations like* “(Smith 2024)”.

If web search yields no directly relevant article, proceed without citation.
